        Personality
        <br>
        Able to respond creatively to situations and unique challenges - I believe my background and
        interest in Fine Art gives me an intuitive understanding and insight into aesthetics - I have always
        loved to create and having the opportunity to do so in a coding environment resonates deeply with
        my artwork - which are full of rhyme and allegory.
        Having worked in other industries - I understand the importance of care and diligence - as well as
        the organisational accuracy this requires - I am somewhat of a perfectionist.
        All knowledge is sacred - be it a small part, or the greater picture, which provides me with the
        enthusiasm and curiosity to learn very quickly. Though I am at the beginning of my journey as a
        developer - I know that my determination will push me to become an integral part of a team.</div>
